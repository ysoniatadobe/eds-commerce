/**
 * This file defines an array of class names that should be excluded
 * from specific init Recaptcha logic.
 *
 * The array contains class names representing elements that should be
 * ignored when certain operations, such as focusing or applying event
 * handlers, are executed.
 *
 * By checking if an element's class matches any class in this array,
 * you can easily bypass unwanted logic for those elements, ensuring
 * precise and predictable behavior in your application.
